# What is that?
That's console application which can generate certificates for server, code sign or email. All sertificates have name which you give them.            Secure algorithm - ```MD5WITHRSA```     
All certificates will save in the users directory: ```.../Users/SomeDeveloper/yourcertificate.p12```

# Customization
You can change type of generated certificate. How?              
[Here](https://github.com/ddoo5/CC/blob/main/Service/Creator/CreatorService.cs) from line 60 to line 62, you can replace or add custom options.
